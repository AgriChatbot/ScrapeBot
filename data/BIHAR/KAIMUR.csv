The crop requires 4 - 6 irrigations depending on the soil type and rainfall. Wheat crop requires minimum of 5 irrigations at the following critical stages.
            I – Immediately after sowing
            II – Crown root intiation : 15-20 DAS 
            III- Active tillering stage : 35-40 DAS
            IV- Flowering stage        : 50-55 DAS
            V- Grain filling stage      : 70-75 DAS
            Crown root initiation and flowering are the most critical stages. Water stagnation should be voided at the time of germination.","BIHAR","KAIMUR","CHAINPUR                                          ","2014-12-05 09:13:39.660"
