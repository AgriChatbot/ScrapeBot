Application of stable bleaching powder (12kg/ha) mixed with fertilizer in furrows while planting reduces wilt incidence by 80%.
Practicing crop rotation for 2-3 years with crops like maize, finger millet, cereals, garlic, lupin, and onion cabbage can reduce the disease inoculum.","CHHATTISGARH","KORIYA","BHARATPUR                                         ","2014-11-01 17:20:44.860"
