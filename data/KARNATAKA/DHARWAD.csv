This system will have a high chance to develop into a tropical cyclone as it inches south southwestward. High seas and strong thunderstorms will impact the island chain. Meanwhile, a broad area of low pressure over the southern Bay of Bengal will initiate rain and thunderstorms from Sri Lanka to the Andaman Sea. These thunderstorms will affect Sri Lanka, northwest Indonesia, northern Malaysia and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Colombo, Sri Lanka, can expect rainy weather throughout the day with a high of 78(F)/ 25(C). In the western Pacific, a low pressure system will be located roughly 600 nautical miles south of Bora Bora. This system will have a high chance to develop into a tropical cyclone as it moves southeastward. A separate system will bring very stormy conditions to American Samoa, and will have a medium chance to develop into a tropical cyclone.
