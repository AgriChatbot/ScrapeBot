Tropical cyclone development is anticipated across the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific on Tuesday. Tropical Cyclone Kate will gradually weaken as it moves southwestward over the Indian Ocean. During the first half of the day, Kate is forecast to be downgraded to a category 1 cyclone, with wind speeds ranging between 74 to 95 mph (64 to 82 kts). By the end of the day, Kate will likely be downgraded to a tropical storm, with wind speeds ranging between 39 to 73 mph (33 to 64 kts). This system will be located approximately 750 nautical miles southwest of the Cocos Islands. Meanwhile, a broad area of low pressure will linger over the southwestern corner of the Bay of Bengal. This system will have a low chance to develop into a tropical cyclone. Regardless of development, rain and thunderstorms will affect the southern tip of India and Sri Lanka. Colombo, Sri Lanka, will experience stormy weather throughout the morning with a high of 83(F)/ 28(C). Additionally, heavy rain and strong thunderstorms will continue to impact eastern Malaysia. In the western Pacific, Tropical Depression Twentythree will push westward over the southern Philippines. This system will usher torrential rain and thunderstorms across a large span of the country.
